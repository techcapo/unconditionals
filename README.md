# unconditionals

32 optical illusions inscribed into Bitcoin, implemented as tiny 2kB self-contained HTML pieces (no external libraries, digital cave paintings should work in a cave!). Despite appearing in strikingly different shades of blue and green, each pair of icons has the same color, expressing that our differences are an illusion and we have more in common than we realize. 

The iconography resonates this insight, depicting things that are Unconditional for all humans: love, death, the need for freedom to transact, to work together and play together. The collection incorporates three specific technologies I have unconditional admiration and love for (Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana) and foreshadows the ultimate technology (AI). Unconditionals finishes on a lighter tone of Entertainment: while solving coordination problems might be the greatest challenge we ever faced, it's important to have fun while doing it.

Our differences are circumstantial. Our love is Unconditional. We are One.
